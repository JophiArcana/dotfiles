Let $ABC$ be a triangle and let the common external tangents to the circumcircle and the $A$-excircle intersect line $BC$ at $P$ and $Q$. Show that $\angle PAB=\angle CAQ$.

Let the tangents through $P$ and $Q$ touch $(ABC)$ at $P'$ and $Q'$ respectively, and let $L$ be the arc midpoint of $BC$ and $I_A$ the $A$-excenter.

Since $\seg{LL}\parallel\seg{BC}$ and $\seg{P'P'}=\seg{PP'}$, it follows that $\seg{P'L}\parallel\seg{PI_A}$. Then, $\da PP'A=\da P'LA=\da PI_AA$, so $PP'AI_A$ and $QQ'AI_A$ are cyclic. Finally, $\da PAI_A=\da PP'I_A=\da I_AQ'Q=\da I_AAQ$, as desired.
