A person flips $2010$ coins at a time. He gains one penny every time he flips a prime number of heads, but must stop once he flips a non-prime number. If his expected amount of money gained in dollars is $\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100m+n$.

$100\cdot2^{2010}$
