Let $n$ be a positive integer, and let $a_1$, $a_2$, $\ldots$, $a_n$ be nonnegative real numbers. Show that \[\frac1{1+a_1}+\frac{a_1}{(1+a_1)(1+a_2)}+\cdots+\frac{a_1a_2\cdots a_{n-1}}{(1+a_1)(1+a_2)\cdots(1+a_n)}\le1.\]
When does equality hold?

Just rewrite the left-hand expression.
\begin{claim*}
    We have that \[\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}a_j}{\prod_{j=1}^i1+a_j}=1-\frac{\prod_{i=1}^na_i}{\prod_{i=1}^n1+a_i}.\]
\end{claim*}
\begin{proof}
    Induction; details omitted.
\end{proof}

From here, it is clear that the left-hand expression does not exceed $1$, with equality attained whenever $0\in\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\}$.
