Prove that there exist infinitely many pairs of relatively prime positive integers $a>1$ and $b>1$ such that $a^b+b^a$ is divisible by $a+b$.

For every $k$, the ordered pair $(2k-1,2k+1)$ works. Both elements are relatively prime. The condition $a+b\mid a^b+b^a$ may be checked via binomial theorem as follows:
\begin{align*}
    (2k-1)^{2k+1}
    &\equiv-1+2k(2k+1)\pmod{4k};\\
    (2k+1)^{2k-1}
    &\equiv-1+2k(2k-1)\pmod{4k}.
\end{align*}
Thus $(2k-1)^{2k+1}+(2k+1)^{2k-1}\equiv0\pmod{4k}$.
