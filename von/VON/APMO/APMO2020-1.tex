Let $\Gamma$ be the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$. Let $D$ be a point on side $BC$. The tangent to $\Gamma$ at $A$ intersects the parallel line to $\seg{AB}$ through $D$ at point $E$. Segment $CE$ intersects $\Gamma$ again at $F$. Suppose $B$, $D$, $F$, $E$ are concyclic. Prove that $\seg{AC}$, $\seg{BF}$, $\seg{DE}$ are concurrent.

Note that $ADCE$ is cyclic. Done by radical axis theorem on $(ABC)$, $(BDFE)$, $(ADCE)$.
