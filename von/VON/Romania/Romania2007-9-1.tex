Let $a,b,c,d,x$ be positive integers obeying \[x^2-\left(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+1\right)x+(a+c)(b+d)=0.\]
Prove that $x$ is a perfect square.

Notice that by AM-GM, \[a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2=\sum_\mathrm{cyc}\frac{a^2+b^2}2\ge ab+bc+cd+da=(a+c)(b+d).\]
Since the polynomial has integer roots, and the linear coefficient exceeds the constant term, one root must be $1$, and we must be in the equality case. Hence, $a=b=c=d$, and the other root is clearly $4a^2$, so we are done.
