Let $a_j$, $b_j$, $c_j$ be integers for $1\le j\le N$. Assume for each $j$, at least one of $a_j$, $b_j$, $c_j$ is odd. Show that there exist integers $r$, $s$, $t$ such that $ra_j+sb_j+tc_j$ is odd for at least $\tfrac{4N}7$ values of $j$, $1\le j\le N$.

We use the probabilistic method. Take everything modulo $2$.
\begin{claim*}
    For all $(a_j,b_j,c_j)\in\mathbb F_2^3$ there are exactly $4$ triples $(r,s,t)\in\mathbb F_2^3$ such that $ra_j+sb_j+tc_j$ is odd.
\end{claim*}
\begin{proof}
    Omitted.
\end{proof}

By linearity of expectation, the expected number of $j$ such that $ra_j+sb_j+tc_j$ given a fixed triple $(r,s,t)$ is $\tfrac{4N}7$, so there is at least one triple $(r,s,t)$ that yields at least $\tfrac{4N}7$ odd.
