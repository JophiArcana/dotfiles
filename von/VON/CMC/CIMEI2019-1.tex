Find the largest positive integer less than $1000$ with the property that both its base-$10$ and base-$8$ representation are palindromes.

For $N$ to have four digits in base $8$, $N\ge512$, but the leading digit must be $1$; otherwise, $N\ge1024$, which is undesirable. Say that $N=\underline1\,\underline{\text d}\,\underline{\text d}\,\underline1{}_8$ for some digit $\text d$. Then for all $\text d$, $N=72\text d+513$ is a palindrome in base $8$, so we just need to find the largest such $N$ that is a palindrome in base $10$. Only $d=1$ works, so the answer is $585$.

585
