Determine all positive integers relatively prime to all the terms of the infinite sequence \[a_n=2^n+3^n+6^n-1,\ n\ge 1.\]

The answer is $1$. We check that all primes divide some element of the sequence. First, $a_2=48$, so henceforth $p\ge5$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, \[2^{p-2}+3^{p-2}+6^{p-2}\equiv2^{-1}+3^{-1}+6^{-1}\equiv1\pmod p,\]
so $p\mid a_{p-2}$ for all $p\ge5$.
