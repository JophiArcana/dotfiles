Given triangle $ABC$ the point $J$ is the centre of the excircle opposite the vertex $A$. This excircle is tangent to the side $BC$ at $M$, and to the lines $AB$ and $AC$ at $K$ and $L$, respectively. The lines $LM$ and $BJ$ meet at $F$, and the lines $KM$ and $CJ$ meet at $G$. Let $S$ be the point of intersection of the lines $AF$ and $BC$, and let $T$ be the point of intersection of the lines $AG$ and $BC$. Prove that $M$ is the midpoint of $ST$.

We begin with the following claim.
\begin{claim*}
    $AFKJLG$ is cyclic.
\end{claim*}
\begin{proof}
    Note $\angle KGC=180\dg-\angle BMK-\angle GCM=\angle A/2$, so symmetrically all six points lie on $(AJ)$.
\end{proof}

Thus $\angle AFJ=90\dg$, so $\seg{AS}\parallel\seg{MK}$. As $BM=BK$, $BA=BS$, so $JA=JS$. Analogously $JA=JT$, so $JS=JT$ and $MS=MT$, completing the proof.
