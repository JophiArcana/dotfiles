Find all functions $f:\mathbb Z_{>0}\to\mathbb Z_{>0}$ satisfying $f(n+1)>f(f(n))$ for every positive integer $n$.

\begin{claim*}
    For all $n$, $f(n)\ge n$.
\end{claim*}
\begin{proof}
    We prove that for all $t>n$, $f(t)\ne n$, which is sufficient. To do this, we induct on $n$. Base case $n=1$: If $f(t)=1$, $t>1$, then $1=f(t).f(f(t-1))$, impossible.

    Now if $f(t)=n$, but $t>n$, then $n=f(t)>f(f(t-1))\ge n$, since $f(t-1)>n-1$. This is the desired contradiction.
\end{proof}

Note $f(n+1)>f(f(n))\ge f(n)$, so $f$ is strictly increasing. Assume there is an $m$ such that for all $n\ge m$, $f(n)>n$. Then take some sufficiently large $n$; since $f(n)\ge n+1$, $f(n+1)>f(f(n))\ge f(n+1)$, wtmoo.

Since $f$ is strictly increasing, $f(n)\equiv n$. This works, completing the proof.
