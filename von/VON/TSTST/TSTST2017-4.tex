Find all nonnegative integer solutions to $2^a+3^b+5^c=n!$.

---

For $n\le4$, it is easy to check the only solutions are $(2,0,0,3)$, $(1,1,0,3)$, $(4,1,1,4)$.

Now we prove there are no solutions $n\ge5$. Indeed, taking modulo $120$ we have
\begin{align*}
    2^a&\pmod{120}\in\{1,2,4,8,16,32,64\};\\
    3^b&\pmod{120}\in\{1,3,9,27,81\};\\
    5^c&\pmod{120}\in\{1,5,25\}.
\end{align*}
By inspection, no three have a vanishing sum.
