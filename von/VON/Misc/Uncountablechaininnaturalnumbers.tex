Determine whether there exists an uncountable family $F$ of subsets of $\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$ with the property that for any $X,Y\subseteq F$, either $X\subseteq Y$ or $Y\subseteq X$.

The answer is yes. Recall that $\mathbb Q\cap(0,1)$ is countable, so enumerate its elements as $a_1$, $a_2$, $\ldots$. Let each real number $r\in(0,1)$ determine a subset consisting of all $i$ such that $a_i<r$. By density no two $r$ determine the same subset, and since $\mathbb R\cap(0,1)$ is uncountable $F$ is too.
