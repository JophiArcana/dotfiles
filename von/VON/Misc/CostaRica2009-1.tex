Let $x$ and $y$ be positive real number such that $(1+x)(1+y)=2$. Prove that \[xy+\frac1{xy}\ge6.\]

Note that $x+y=1-xy$. By the AM-HM inequality, 
\begin{align*}
\frac{x+y}2&\ge\frac{2xy}{x+y}\\
\implies(x+y)^2&\ge4xy\\
\implies(1-xy)^2&\ge4xy\\
\implies(xy)^2+1&\ge6xy\\
\implies xy+\frac1{xy}&\ge6,
\end{align*}
as desired.
