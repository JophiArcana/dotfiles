Do there exist four vectors, no two parallel, such that the sum of any two of these vectors is orthogonal to the sum of the other two?

The answer is yes. Take a triangle $ABC$ with orthocenter $H$, and a point $P$ on the nine-point circle of $\triangle ABC$. I claim the vectors $\overrightarrow{PA}$, $\overrightarrow{PB}$, $\overrightarrow{PC}$, $\overrightarrow{PH}$ obey the condition.

By symmetry, it suffices to show $\overrightarrow{PB}+\overrightarrow{PC}$ and $\overrightarrow{PA}+\overrightarrow{PH}$ are orthogonal. Note that if $M$ and $N$ are the midpoints of $\seg{BC}$ and $\seg{AH}$ respectively, $\overrightarrow{PB}+\overrightarrow{PC}$ is parallel to $\overrightarrow{PM}$, and $\overrightarrow{PA}+\overrightarrow{PH}$ is parallel to $\overrightarrow{PN}$. Since $\seg{MN}$ is a diameter of the nine-point circle, $\angle MPN=90\dg$, as desired.
