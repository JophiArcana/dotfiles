Suppose $r$, $s$, $t$ are the roots of the polynomial $x^3-2x+3$. Compute \[\frac1{r^3-2}+\frac1{s^3-2}+\frac1{t^3-2}.\]

---

By inspection $r^3-2=2r-5$. The polynomial with roots $2r-5$, $2s-5$, $2t-5$ is given by \[P\left(\frac12(x+5)\right)=\frac18\left(x^3+15x^2+67x+108\right).\]
Hence the answer is $-67/109$ by Vieta's Formulae.
