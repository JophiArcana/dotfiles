A square can be divided into four congruent figures as shown:
\begin{center}
    \begin{asy}
        size(2cm);
        draw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2)--cycle);
        draw((1,0)--(1,2));
        draw((0,1)--(2,1));
    \end{asy}
\end{center}
For how many $n$ with $1 \le n \le 100$ can a unit square be divided into $n$ congruent figures?
